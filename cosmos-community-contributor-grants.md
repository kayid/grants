# Cosmos Community Contributor Grants

This grant awarded to people who have done exceptional work throughout the process of bootstrapping the Cosmos community since 2019 and—for some—even earlier. They were simply chosen because they each took the initiative to build their respective communities out of passion for the project.

All of the recipients have been onboarded as vendors to All in Bits Inc (dba Tendermint Inc), where each vendor received between $1000-$3000 USD in Q1. With that, ambassadors are now able to kick off and get reimbursed for future meetups in regions all over the world for the next 12 months. 

In total, there were 27 Community Contributors who we recognize as stellar stewards of the network.

## Wishlist!

Cosmos constantly keeps track of contributors who meet three criteria.

- They must have done some prior work that got them noticed (e.g. published a technical, informative blog post, ran a meetup, etc.). 
- They must have been a part of the Cosmos community for at least 3 months and are knowledgeable about the breadth of instruments that are used for composing interoperable application-specific blockchains (e.g. Cosmos SDK, Tendermint, IBC, Peggy, etc.). 
- The prior work that was done must not have been a one-off event but part of an ongoing, self-directed string of events that demonstrates their long-term commitment.

Activities could fall into any one or more of these categories:

- Runs a [Cosmos Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cosmos_network/)
- Runs a [Cosmos community chat channel](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/communities-cosmos-tendermint-support-chats-forums/2737) in various languages
- Runs a Cosmos [country name] Twitter handle that regularly re-posts translated content from the [Cosmos account](https://twitter.com/cosmos)
- Builds explorers, visualizers, network monitoring tools, etc.
- Translates [Cosmos documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/docs)
- Translates [Today in Cosmos](https://twitter.com/search?q=today%20in%20cosmos&src=typed_query)
- Makes pull requests, bug reports, or upstreams modules to the Cosmos stack
- Other (contact [Chjango Unchained](https://twitter.com/chjango/))
