# ConsenSys Grants

ConsenSys Grants funds blockchain technology projects that meet the needs of a rapidly-accelerating Ethereum ecosystem. Some key areas include: core infrastructure, social impact, improved developer tooling and UX, security, and access to education. We are equally focused on funding core components and technology that will enable far-reaching community building projects in the blockchain space.

### Infrastructure

[Gas Stations Network](https://www.cypherhunter.com/en/p/824121470232/) ([source code](https://github.com/opengsn/gsn), [email](mailto:team@opengsn.org)) / EIP-1613 – $25,000. Solving the gasless users onboarding problem in a trustless decentralized way through a network of incentivized relays. 

[Notus](https://www.cypherhunter.com/en/p/566937912133/) – $10,000. A service that allows users to trigger webhooks from Ethereum smart contract events or Graph Protocol GraphQL subscriptions.

### Education & Technical Knowledge

[Black Girls CODE Blockchain Immersion Program](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/) – $25,000.

BGC seeks to provide young women of color with the skills to both develop into thought leaders within the developer space and occupy developer, designer, and business roles in the expanding blockchain ecosystem. To do so, Black Girls CODE is developing a three-tiered blockchain program that focuses on education, immersion, and the provision of “hackternships” to test practical ecosystem knowledge. 

[Africa Blockchain Developers Program](http://afriblockchain.org/developer/) –  $10,000.

The goal of the Ethereum developer program is to give African developers the opportunity to gain the skills necessary to become industry-ready blockchain developers. ABA is working with our network of partners across the continent to provide mentorship and support activities to developers. Projects for participants sponsored through this grant will be social impact challenges to solve unique African problems co-ideated with ConsenSys. 

### Security

[Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.sigmaprime.io/) - $25,000. A security-focused Ethereum Serenity client.

Lighthouse is a security-focused Ethereum Serenity client. As a free, open-source Ethereum Serenity client, Lighthouse will enable users to enjoy the benefits of a sharded, proof-of-stake Ethereum platform, providing at least 1000x capacity. This project lays the foundation for future improvements that can provide exponential scalability to Ethereum. Further, proof-of-stake eliminates resource-intensive mining operations, minimizing energy consumption.
