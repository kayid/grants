# Ethereum Foundation Grants

Ethereum Foundation Grants (ÐΞVgrants) is a program that offers funding for contributions to both the Ethereum platform, and projects based on Ethereum. Its goals are threefold:

- To provide developers interested in contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem the opportunity to spend significant time on their project, in order to bring it to completion.
- To extend the codebase with useful components that are not the main focus of ΞTHDEV, but which would be very valuable to users of Ethereum generally.
- To increase our outreach to other communities and the general public.
